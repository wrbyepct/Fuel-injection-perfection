Informal Structured Outline



Problem type:
   Pattern detecting


The gist of the problem:
    Find the least amount of operations within the restricted arithmatic rules
    divided by 2 , subtract 1, add 1
    Find the quickest way to let the number go down to 1

Input range:
    integer > 0, could up to 309 digits long


Concerned target:
    When encountering odd number, which even number to go to?

Goal:
    To decide correctly which even number to go to


What we have known:
    1. If the number is even, always go down to with divided by 2
    2. If the number is odd, there only 2 choices:
        either add + 1 or subtract 1
    3. Let's say n is odd number, then either n + 1 or n - 1
        is a number can be divided by 4
        E.g.
            Given a number line:
                4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
            and their remainders of mod 4
                0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2,  3,  0
            If we only look at the odd number:
                5, 7, 9 ,11
            and their remainders of mod 4
                1, 3, 1, 3
            the number of their left and right is either 0 or 2
                For 5, it's 4 or 6(0, 2)
                For 7, it's 6 or 8(2, 0)
                For 9, it's 10 or 8(0, 2)
                For 11, it's 10 or 12(2, 0)

Conclusion:
    1. If it's an odd number, and then we choose the even number that can always be cut down by 4 at least
        In this way, we can make sure we choose the quickest way to 1
    2. The only exception is when the odd number is 3, because:
        3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
        3 -> 2 -> 1
    3. So the loop will stop if the number is less than or equal to 3

Must do in order to achieve the goal:
    1. For cases that the number is less than or equal to 3, we directly give the operations
        n = 3 -> 2
        n = 2 -> 1
    2. Otherwise, follow these 2 cases:
        even number -> always cut half 2
        odd number -> go to the number that can be cut half twice (divisible by 4)
